# Random Rectangular Maze Generator
Generates and shows a rectangular maze according to width and height input.

**Base Algorithm:**
1. Choose the initial cell, mark it as visited and push it to the stack
2. While the stack is not empty
    - Pop a cell from the stack and make it a current cell
    - If the current cell has any neighbours which have not been visited
        - Push the current cell to the stack
        - Choose one of the unvisited neighbours
        - Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
        - Mark the chosen cell as visited and push it to the stack
